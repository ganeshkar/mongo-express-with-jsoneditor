# mongo-express-with-jsoneditor

It is the exactly same thing as mongo-express but only difference is that while you are viewing a document from a clletion, the  it will be displayed in JSON editor. When your document is too large then it's really hard to edit anything by simple text editor. Jsoneditor is really a handfull tool which allows to add child in a JSON, provides drag & drop features to make any alterations.
